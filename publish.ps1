  publish.ps1  -  One-command publish/update for an ExB custom widget repo.
  1. Copies the latest widget from the EB folder into this repo's widget subfolder
     (skips node_modules, .vs, and any working folders listed in $ExcludeDirs,
     such as "Claude outputs").
  2. Removes those excluded folders from the repo subfolder if an earlier run or a
     hand copy left them there, so they never reach GitHub or the release zip.
  3. Auto-runs 'git init' on first use if the folder is not a git repo yet.
  4. Commits.
  5. Publishes the repo to GitHub on first run, or pushes updates after.
  6. (Optional) Cuts a versioned GitHub Release with a downloadable zip. The zip is
     built from a staging copy with the editor-only files in $ReleaseOnlyExclude
     removed (Visual Studio type shims, dev tools). Those stay in the GitHub repo.
     The release tag must equal the version in manifest.json and package.json, and
     those two must agree, so a release can never ship a version nobody bumped.

  RUN (from a terminal opened in this repo folder):
    Normal update:            powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1
    Update + release v1.1.0:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0
    With a commit message:    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0 -CommitMessage "Subject`n`nBody"

  REDO A RELEASE (the tag must not already exist on GitHub):
    gh release delete v1.1.0 --cleanup-tag --yes
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\publish.ps1 -Release v1.1.0 -CommitMessage "..."

# Visual Studio can type check this widget in isolation (playbook Section 12, item 3).

# one folder level only, so a shim that lives deeper needs its own entry.
